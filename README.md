### Locations for analysis

For the analysis following cities are picked:

* [Aligarh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aligarh)

#### Reason for picking the above location

* **Aligarh** is my hometown and is also known as _City of Locks_. Having a numerous large scale manufacturing units in this city, will like to study the how lockdown really impacted the air quality in this city.

* **Bengaluru** is known as _Silicon Valley of India_ and most of the tech companies has their headquarter in this city. This city is also known as most [traffic-congested city](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-has-worlds-worst-traffic-congestion-says-study/articleshow/73753146.cms).
